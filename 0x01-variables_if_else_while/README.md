## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else statements`
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
* How to use the `while` loop
* How to use variables with the `while` loop
* How to print variables using `printf`
* What is the `ASCII` character set
* What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will compiled with `gcc` 4.8.4 using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
* There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
* You are not allowed to use `system`
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
### Mandatory
- [x] **[0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)** - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
- [x] **[1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c)** - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
- [x] **[2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- [x] **[3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c)** - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
