# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
## Resources :books:

* [What is a Doubly Linked List](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/d6DW7K0HrkIcVdzZxkidDw)

## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* What is a doubly linked list
* How to use doubly linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc` 4.8.4 using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, `printf` and `exit`
* You are allowed to use _putchar
* You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `lists.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
### Mandatory
- [x] **[0. Print list](./0-print_dlistint.c)** - Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
- [x] **[1. List length](./1-dlistint_len.c)** - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
- [x] **[2. Add node](./2-add_dnodeint.c)** - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
- [x] **[3. Add node at the end](./3-add_dnodeint_end.c)** - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
- [x] **[4. Free list](./4-free_dlistint.c)** - Write a function that free a dlistint_t list.
- [x] **[5. Get node at index](./5-get_dnodeint.c)** - Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
- [x] **[6. Sum list](./6-sum_dlistint.c)** - Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
- [x] **[7. Insert at index](./7-insert_dnodeint.c)** - Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
- [x] **[8. Delete at index](./8-delete_dnodei)** - Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
### Advance :muscle:
