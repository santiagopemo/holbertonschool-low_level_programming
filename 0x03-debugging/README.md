# 0x03. C - Debugging
## Resources :books:

* [Debugging](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/iADtJa-KkjYI56m-cQyWIw)
* [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/sS_CVV32moC3tyEImNCvig)
* [The Framework](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/hOysHXgZuRhbwunauqFK6Q)

## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages

## Requirements :white_check_mark:

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc` 4.8.4 using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* A `README.md` file at the root of the `holbertonschool-low_level_programming` repo, containing a description of the repository
* A `README.m` file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
### Mandatory
- [x] **[0-main.c](./0-main.c)** - Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
- [x] **[1-main.c](./1-main.c)** - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- [x] **[2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c)** - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
- [x] **[3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c)** - Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
