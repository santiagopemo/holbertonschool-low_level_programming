## Resources :books:

* [how to compile with unused variables](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/k7iIVMXLkWDm2D2ATHb6xw)

## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc` 4.8.4 using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md file`, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `holberton.h`
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
